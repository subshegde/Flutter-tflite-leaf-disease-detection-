Mango Leaf Disease Detection with Flutter + tflite
Goal: To create a mobile app that can identify diseases in mango leaves using a machine learning model.

Data Collection: Gather images of mango leaves, both healthy and diseased, to train the model.

Teachable Machine:

Use Googleâ€™s Teachable Machine to upload your images.
Train the model by labeling images (e.g., healthy, diseased).
Exporting the Model: After training, export the model as a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) file, which is lightweight and suitable for mobile use.

Flutter App Development:

Create a Flutter app where users can take or upload photos of mango leaves.
Integrate the TFLite model into the app to analyze the images.
Detection Process:

When a user captures an image, the app processes it using the TFLite model.
The model classifies the leaf as healthy or diseased and displays the result.
Benefits:

Quick and easy diagnosis for farmers.
Accessible tool to help manage crop health.
This approach combines machine learning with Flutter to create a practical solution for identifying mango leaf diseases!
